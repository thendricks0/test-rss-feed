&lt;strong&gt;Description : &lt;/strong&gt;color-name is a JSON with CSS color names. On 8 September 2025, an npm publishing account for color-name was taken over after a phishing attack. Version 2.0.1 was published, functionally identical to the previous patch version, but with a malware payload added attempting to redirect cryptocurrency transactions to the attacker's own addresses from within browser environments. Local environments, server environments, command line applications, etc. are not affected. If the package was used in a browser context (e.g. a direct &lt;script&gt; inclusion, or via a bundling tool such as Babel, Rollup, Vite, Next.js, etc.) there is a chance the malware still exists and such bundles will need to be rebuilt. The malware seemingly only targets cryptocurrency transactions and wallets such as MetaMask. See references below for more information on the payload. npm removed the offending package from the registry over the course of the day on 8 September, preventing further downloads from npm proper. On 13 September, the package owner published new patch versions to help cache-bust those using private registries who might still have the compromised version cached. Users should update to the latest patch version, completely remove their node_modules directory, clean their package manager's global cache, and rebuild any browser bundles from scratch. Those operating private registries or registry mirrors should purge the offending versions from any caches. This issue is resolved in 2.0.2.

From 1.0 through 1.8, the &lt;3d&gt; parser tag and the {{#3d}} parser function allow users to provide custom attributes that are then appended to the canvas HTML element that is being output by the extension.

&lt;strong&gt;Description : &lt;/strong&gt;Dataease is an open source data analytics and visualization platform. In Dataease versions up to 2.10.12 the H2 data source implementation (H2.java) does not verify that a provided JDBC URL starts with jdbc:h2. This lack of validation allows a crafted JDBC configuration that substitutes the Amazon Redshift driver and leverages the socketFactory and socketFactoryArg parameters to invoke org.springframework.context.support.FileSystemXmlApplicationContext or ClassPathXmlApplicationContext with an attacker‑controlled remote XML resource, resulting in remote code execution. Versions up to and including 2.10.12 are affected. The issue is fixed in version 2.10.13. Updating to version 2.10.13 or later is the recommended remediation. No known workarounds exist.

The rfpiped service listening on TCP port 555 which uses static AES encryption keys hardcoded in the binary. These keys are identical across all devices, allowing attackers to craft encrypted packets that execute arbitrary commands without authentication. This is a failed patch for CVE-2017-7318. This issue may affect other Etherhaul series devices with shared firmware.

&lt;strong&gt;Description : &lt;/strong&gt;Dataease is an open-source data visualization and analysis platform. In versions up to and including 2.10.12, the Impala data source is vulnerable to remote code execution due to insufficient filtering in the getJdbc method of the io.dataease.datasource.type.Impala class. Attackers can construct malicious JDBC connection strings that exploit JNDI injection and trigger RMI deserialization, ultimately enabling remote command execution. The vulnerability can be exploited by editing the data source and providing a crafted JDBC connection string that references a remote configuration file, leading to RMI-based deserialization attacks. This issue has been patched in version 2.10.13. It is recommended to upgrade to the latest version. No known workarounds exist for affected versions.
